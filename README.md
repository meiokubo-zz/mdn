## üöÄ Get started

1. Log in to your terminal
2. cd into your cloud drive directory

	*i.e.*

	\* replace `<username>` with your user name

	For macOS
	```shell
	- OneDrive
	$ cd /Users/<username>/OneDrive

	- Google Drive
	$ cd /Users/<username>/Google\ Drive

	- iCloud Drive
	$ cd /Users/<username>/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com\~apple\~CloudDocs
	```

	For Windows
	```shell
	- OneDrive

	- Google Drive

	- iCloud Drive

	```

3. Create `mdn` directory. This is your note library.

4. Add alias to your note library in the shell command settings

	For zsh (replace .zshrc with .bashrc for bash shells)
	```shell
	$ echo 'alias mdn="cd /Users/<username>/OneDrive/mdn >> /Users/<username>/.zshrc
	```

5. (Optional) Add note library to your private git repository

	You can also backup your Note Library to git repository of your choice.

	For Bitbuckt (Unlimited free private repositories)
	```shell
	$ git init
	$ git add -A
	$ git commit -am "Initialized repository"
	$ git remote add <name> <url>
	```
